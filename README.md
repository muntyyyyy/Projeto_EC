# Projeto EC 2024/2025
Projeto da unidade currícular Engenharia do Conhecimento
Projeto desenvolvido por:
* Marcelo Munteanu
* Pedro Junior
* Pedro Elias

O projeto consiste no treino de vários modelos para corresponder a diferente objetivos pedidos no enunciado.

#### Enunciado
Objetives:
***O1:***
* For this objectve, it is necessary to know if a person has died considering the attributes in the data provided. Students can add new features whenever they consider it appropriate.

* Students should provide the best possible classification models using whatever method covered in class ***[Remember: everything else being similar, the simplest models should be preferred].***

* Models should examine different hyperparameters and select the best one

***O2:***
* Can we confidently predict the AGE of the subject given the other attributes?

***O3:***
* Considering only the people who died, can we confidently predict the age of the people who did and didn't have Covid?

***O4:***
* What are the most significant features in the best models obtained above (in O1, O2 and O3)?

***Processing Notes***
* Your notebook should be prepared to test the models with the independent test set.  Failling to do so, will significantly penalise the project.  Mock-ups of test data files are available for the effect, eg. proj-test-data.csv and project-test-class.csv.

* For more information about the data of each column see Section 2.

***Evaluation***
* The work will be evaluated taking into account:
    * the description of the steps taken to achieve the objectives
    * the implementation according to the mentioned description
    * the evaluation of the best models performance obtained in an independent test set
    * an individual quizz test on the developed project, hands on in the lab computer (in the last TP class)

***Submission***
Students should submit a ZIP file (no other compression algorithms allowed) with 2 documents

* PDF - Report with 6 pages MAXIMUM [aprox. 3000 words], containing
    * Header:
        * Group number
        * Student names and ids
        * how many hours each student contributed to the project

    * ***Report text***

        * Introduction and Goals - brief description of the task, data and goals.
        * Data processing - Briefly describe all data processing steps
        * Variable selection - Describe the approach followed for variable selection
        * Model results - should include a table with the statistics for the best models tested
        * Hyperparameter tuning - briefly describe which parameters were tuned and how
        * Discussion and Conclusions
    * all sections can be supported by graphics
* Jupyter Notebook with the source code and attached results that led to the report. ***This Notebook with outputs should never be larger than 12 pages*** [penalties will be applied if size is exceeded]

***Submission***
    * Submit the zip file on Moodle with one submission per group, up to May 26 at 12:00
